<h1>Predicting the Ice Age distribution of a cave-dwelling scorpion</h1>

<p>This repository has all the code you need to predict the distribution of a scorpion during the last ice age. <br>
*   organization.r will organize the data</p>

<ul>
<li><p>scorp<em>run</em>models.r will call the four algorithms that are in the ctf<em>run4models.r Then there are four different files that begin with 'prediction', for example prediction</em>on<em>ccsm</em>data.r.  These will produce the predicted distribution for a particular model of climate. CCSM and MIROC are two different global circulation models of the climate at last glacial maximum. The distribution is also predicted for the last interglacial (warm) period.</p></li>
<li><p>the climate data and some data objects can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5PrX6jthQFAcEtKSFZzQjVSQlE/">here</a></p></li>
</ul>
